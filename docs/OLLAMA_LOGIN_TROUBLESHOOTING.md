# üîç Ollama Login Troubleshooting Guide

If you can't find the "Sign in with GitHub" button, here are alternative methods to access Ollama's model submission.

## üåê **Alternative URLs to Try**

The submission page might be at different URLs. Try these in order:

### **Primary Options:**
1. **https://ollama.com/new** (main submission page)
2. **https://ollama.com/create** (alternative submission URL)
3. **https://ollama.com/submit** (another possible URL)
4. **https://ollama.com/models/new** (models section)

### **Login First Approach:**
1. **https://ollama.com/login** (direct login page)
2. **https://ollama.com/signin** (alternative login)
3. **https://ollama.com** (main page, then look for login)

## üîê **Different Login Methods**

### **Method 1: Main Ollama Website**
1. Go to **https://ollama.com**
2. Look for these buttons in the top-right corner:
   - "Sign In"
   - "Login" 
   - "Get Started"
   - GitHub icon
3. Click any of these to start the login process

### **Method 2: GitHub OAuth Direct**
1. Go to **https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=ollama**
2. This should redirect you to GitHub's OAuth page
3. Authorize Ollama to access your account
4. You'll be redirected back to Ollama

### **Method 3: Account Creation**
1. Go to **https://ollama.com**
2. Look for "Sign Up" or "Create Account"
3. Choose "Continue with GitHub" option
4. Complete the account setup process

## üñ•Ô∏è **What to Look For on the Page**

The login button might appear as:
- **"Sign in with GitHub"** (black button with GitHub logo)
- **"Continue with GitHub"** (white/gray button)
- **GitHub logo/icon** (just the GitHub cat logo)
- **"Login"** (generic login that offers GitHub option)
- **"Get Started"** (which then shows GitHub option)

## üì± **Browser-Specific Issues**

### **If Using Safari:**
- Disable "Prevent cross-site tracking" temporarily
- Allow pop-ups for ollama.com
- Clear cookies and try again

### **If Using Chrome/Edge:**
- Disable ad blockers temporarily
- Allow third-party cookies for ollama.com
- Try incognito/private mode

### **If Using Firefox:**
- Set "Enhanced Tracking Protection" to Standard
- Allow cookies for ollama.com
- Clear site data and retry

## üîÑ **Step-by-Step Troubleshooting**

### **Step 1: Clear Browser Data**
```
1. Clear cookies for ollama.com
2. Clear cache
3. Restart browser
4. Try again
```

### **Step 2: Try Different Browser**
```
1. Open Chrome/Firefox/Safari (different from current)
2. Go to https://ollama.com
3. Look for login options
4. Try the GitHub login process
```

### **Step 3: Check Ollama Status**
```
1. Go to https://status.ollama.com (if exists)
2. Check their Twitter @ollama for updates
3. Look for maintenance announcements
```

## üÜò **Alternative Submission Methods**

### **Method 1: GitHub Repository Approach**
If the web submission isn't working, you might be able to:
1. Fork Ollama's model repository (if they have one)
2. Submit a pull request with your model
3. Follow their contribution guidelines

### **Method 2: Community Channels**
1. **Discord**: Join Ollama's Discord server
2. **GitHub**: Check Ollama's GitHub for submission instructions
3. **Email**: Look for contact information on their website

### **Method 3: Wait and Retry**
Sometimes the submission system might be:
- Under maintenance
- Experiencing high traffic
- Being updated

## üìß **Contact Ollama Support**

If none of the above works:

### **Find Contact Information:**
1. Go to **https://ollama.com/contact**
2. Look for "Support" or "Help" links
3. Check their GitHub repository for issues
4. Find their Discord or community channels

### **What to Include in Your Message:**
```
Subject: Unable to Access Model Submission Page

Hi Ollama Team,

I'm trying to submit a custom model (Olympus-Coder) to your library but cannot find the GitHub login option on the submission page.

Details:
- Visited: https://ollama.com/new
- Browser: [Your browser and version]
- Issue: Cannot locate "Sign in with GitHub" button
- Model: AI coding assistant built on CodeLlama 13B
- Repository: https://github.com/chandan1819/olympus-coder

Could you please provide the correct submission process or URL?

Thank you!
```

## üîç **Current Status Check**

### **Check These Resources:**
1. **Ollama Documentation**: https://ollama.ai/docs
2. **Ollama GitHub**: https://github.com/ollama/ollama
3. **Community Forums**: Look for recent discussions about model submission

### **Recent Changes:**
Ollama might have:
- Changed their submission process
- Moved to a different URL
- Temporarily disabled submissions
- Updated their authentication system

## ‚úÖ **Working Alternatives**

### **If Web Submission Doesn't Work:**

#### **Option 1: Build Community Interest First**
1. Share your model on social media
2. Get community feedback and stars on GitHub
3. Build a user base
4. Ollama might reach out to you

#### **Option 2: Manual Distribution**
1. Keep using your current GitHub distribution
2. Create installation scripts for easy setup
3. Build community around your repository
4. Submit to Ollama later when the process is clearer

#### **Option 3: Alternative Platforms**
1. **Hugging Face**: Upload to Hugging Face Hub
2. **Docker Hub**: Create Docker images
3. **PyPI**: Create Python packages
4. **Homebrew**: Create Homebrew formulas

## üéØ **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Right Now:**
1. **Try https://ollama.com** (main page)
2. **Look for any login/signup options**
3. **Check the navigation menu** for "Models" or "Submit"
4. **Try different browsers** if the first doesn't work

### **If Still Not Working:**
1. **Document the issue** (screenshots help)
2. **Check Ollama's social media** for announcements
3. **Continue building your community** on GitHub
4. **Try again in a few days**

### **Meanwhile:**
Your model is already:
- ‚úÖ **Fully functional** and tested
- ‚úÖ **Well documented** with comprehensive guides
- ‚úÖ **Community ready** with IDE integrations
- ‚úÖ **Professional quality** with proper licensing

The GitHub repository at https://github.com/chandan1819/olympus-coder is already helping developers, and that's the most important thing!

**Don't worry - even if Ollama submission is delayed, your model is already making an impact through GitHub distribution!** üöÄ
